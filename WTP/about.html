            <h3> India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich
                cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its
                Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top
                industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to
                conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from
                the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest
                country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and
                the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in
                the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean
                between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. </h3>
